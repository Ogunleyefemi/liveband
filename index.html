Some of the artists on this list are no longer with us, some have already performed their swan song and others are still touring the world. They all have one thing in common — they’re considered the best live bands of all time, based on the votes of the Ranker community. (The ranking is based on the results as Feb. 21, 2019; some biographical details within the article have been updated more recently.) </p></div>

        <h2 div class="header2">some amazing live bands.</h2>   
        
        <ol>
            <li>Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers</li>
            <img src="img/tom petty.jpg" alt="tom petty">
            <p class="bg-success">Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers toured the world right up until lead singer Tom Petty died suddenly in 2017, at the age of 66. The band’s final tour, which celebrated their 40th anniversary, concluded with three nights at the Hollywood Bowl. The set list included rarely played tracks such as “Rockin’ Around (With You),” which was the first track on their 1976 debut album, “Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,” and which hadn’t been performed live since 1983. </p>
            <li>The Allman Brothers Band </li>
            <img src="img/allman.jpg" alt="allman brothers">
            <p class="bg-info"> One of the most legendary gigs in the history of The Allman Brothers Band took place on March 13, 1971, at Fillmore East Theater in New York. The band gave the audience nearly 23 minutes of “Whipping Post,” the last song on the band’s first album and a staple of their live shows. Three months later, the Allman Brothers Band returned to Fillmore East to give the venue a memorable sendoff before it closed its doors for the last time, playing until dawn.</p>

            <li> Alice Cooper </li>
            <img src="img/alice cooper.jpg" alt="alice">
            <p class="bg-warning">Alice Cooper’s live shows, known for their theatrical elements, bring his tracks to life. Described as a “shock-rock” anti-hero, Cooper delighted British audiences in 2017 when he reunited with his original band for his first U.K. tour in five years. Today, at the age of 71, Cooper shows no sign of slowing down. </p>
